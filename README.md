# HybridJS

## How to set up development

You will need:

- The latest version of NodeJS installed
- The latest version of npm installed
- A modern web browser installed
- A modern operating system installed
- A computer, as it would be painful to live life without one, wouldn't it?

Steps

1. Clone the repository locally
2. Navigate to the folder of the repository
3. Open a terminal in the root folder
4. Run `npm i` to install all dependencies, this may take a few minutes
5. Run `npm run dev` to open a local development server at port 3000
6. Navigate to localhost:3000 in your web browser of choice
7. On saving a file in the `/src` directory, your changes will be shown in the browser immediately.
